Hello!

This is a simple grid I made that will allow you to navigate around in a canvas. It's rather simplistic, but it should respect the bounds of the canvas and "collide" with the edge.

This project uses ES6 modules, so you will need to deploy it on a local web server if you plan on running it locally.
